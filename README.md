# C++ QueueManipulation
Create an interactive driver that will easily allow user to manipulate a queue. 
Your queue should have a list cursor (a pointer that points to the “current”  item in the list).  The user should be able to enter one command 
and arguments per line or the user should be able to stack commands.  Again, the list should be printed the line above the UI cursor,
so the user knows the current state of the queue.
